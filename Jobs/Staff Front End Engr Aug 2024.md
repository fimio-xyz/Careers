## A Note From our CEO
At Fimio, our goal is to be git for builds. We are picking up where git left off. Our ambition is to create a modern universal build system with fully reproducible builds built in from the ground up. Our point of view is that we can create secure build systems via full transparency. 

We are looking for a staff engineer to join our team and own our front-end. We want someone who is deeply interested in improving the user experience for developers with regards to how they build their applications and deploy them to the cloud. Our front-end is written in a mixture of React and TypeScript, and I am looking for someone who can come in to own that code base and innovate on it. 

The right candidate will need to be interested in understanding build systems, security, as well as have a passion for great user experience and design. I believe developers need to have the best tools and deserve to build with tools that are lovingly designed and are aesthetically pleasing, and I hope you feel the same!

My goal at Fimio is to create tools that are the quintessence of their genre. At Fimio, we spend a lot of our engineering effort building products that beautifully bridge the knowledge gap between infrastructure and code. Here are a few essays that have served as inspiration for our worldview with regards to developer tools:

- [The Case for Developer Experience](https://future.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/), Jean Yang
- [Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210), Ken Thompson
- [Reproducibility in Software Engineering](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12666899), Pol Dellaiera
